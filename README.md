# Chart.js and React

I want to use a chart in one of my projects, and I found this awesome library called Chart.js. In this repo, I explore some features of this library, the first chart is based on a tutorial from Traversy media [link](https://youtu.be/Ly-9VTXJlnA), the second is an implementation that fits my need.
